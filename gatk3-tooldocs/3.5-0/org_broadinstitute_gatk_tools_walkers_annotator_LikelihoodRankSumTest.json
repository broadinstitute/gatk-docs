  "description": "\n\n \u003cp\u003eThis variant-level annotation compares the likelihoods of reads to their best haplotype match, between reads that support the reference allele and those that support the alternate allele. The ideal result is a value close to zero, which indicates there is little to no difference.  A negative value indicates that the reads supporting the alternate allele have lower likelihoods to their best haplotype match than those supporting the reference allele. Conversely, a positive value indicates that the reads supporting the alternate allele have higher likelihoods to their best haplotype match than those supporting the reference allele. Finding a statistically significant difference either way suggests that the sequencing and/or mapping process may have been biased or affected by an artifact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eStatistical notes\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eThe value output for this annotation is the u-based z-approximation from the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test for per-read likelihoods to the best haplotype match (likelihoods of reads supporting REF vs. likelihoods of reads supporting ALT).
