  "description": "\n\n \u003cp\u003eCombineVariants reads in variants records from separate ROD (Reference-Ordered Data) sources and combines them into\n a single VCF. Any number of sources can be input. This tool aims to fulfill two main possible use cases, reflected\n by the two combination options (MERGE and UNION), for merging records at the variant level (the first 8 fields of\n the VCF) or at the genotype level (the rest).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cul\u003e\n \u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eMERGE:\u003c/b\u003e combines multiple variant records present at the same site in the different input sources into a\n single variant record in the output. If sample names overlap, then they are \"uniquified\" by default, which means a\n suffix is appended to make them unique. \u003cem\u003eNote that in version 3.3, the automatic uniquifying was disabled\n (unintentionally), and required setting `-genotypeMergeOptions UNIQUIFY` manually.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\n \u003cli\u003e\u003cb\u003eUNION:\u003c/b\u003e assumes that each ROD source represents the same set of samples (although this is not enforced).\n It uses the priority list (if provided) to emit a single record instance at every position represented in the input RODs.\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003c/ul\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eBy default, the input sets will be named variants, variants2, variants3, and so on. You can override this by\n providing an explicit name tag for each input, using the syntax \" -V:format,name\". Each input tagged in this\n way will be labeled as such in the output (i.e., set\u003dname rather than set\u003dvariants2). For example, you could specify\n a set of control samples as \" -V:vcf,control my_control_samples.vcf\", and the resulting VCF records would contain\n the annotation \"set\u003dcontrol\" in the INFO field. It is strongly recommended to provide explicit names in this way\n when a rod priority list is provided.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003cp\u003eCombineVariants will emit a record for every site that was present in any of your input VCF files, and will annotate\n (in the set attribute in the INFO field) whether the record had a PASS or FILTER status in each input ROD . In effect,\n CombineVariants always produces a union of the input VCFs.  However, any part of the Venn of the merged VCFs\n can be extracted using JEXL expressions on the set attribute using SelectVariants.  If you want to extract just\n the records in common between two VCFs, you would first run CombineVariants on the two files to generate a single\n VCF and then run SelectVariants to extract the common records with `-select \u0027set \u003d\u003d \"Intersection\"\u0027`, as worked out\n in the detailed example in the documentation guide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eInput\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cp\u003e\n Two or more variant sets to combine.\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eOutput\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cp\u003e\n A combined VCF.\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eUsage examples\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u0026nbsp;\n \u003ch4\u003eMerge two separate callsets\u003c/h4\u003e\n \u003cpre\u003e\n java -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar \\\n   -T CombineVariants \\\n   -R reference.fasta \\\n   --variant input1.vcf \\\n   --variant input2.vcf \\\n   -o output.vcf \\\n   -genotypeMergeOptions UNIQUIFY\n \u003c/pre\u003e\n\n \u003ch4\u003eGet the union of calls made on the same samples \u003c/h4\u003e\n \u003cpre\u003e\n java -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar \\\n   -T CombineVariants \\\n   -R reference.fasta \\\n   --variant:foo input1.vcf \\\n   --variant:bar input2.vcf \\\n   -o output.vcf \\\n   -genotypeMergeOptions PRIORITIZE \\\n   -priority foo,bar\n \u003c/pre\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eCaveats\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cul\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eThis tool is not intended to manipulate GVCFS!

In this case each thread spends CPU time\n doing the conversion, and the GATK engine is smart enough to merge the partial BCF2 blocks together\n efficiently.  However, since this merge runs in only one thread, you can quickly reach diminishing\n returns with the number of parallel threads.  In our hands, `-nt 4` works well but `-nt 8` tends to be be too much.\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eSince GATK 2.1, when merging multiple VCF records at a site, the combined VCF record has the QUAL of the first\n VCF record with a non-MISSING QUAL value.  The previous behavior was to take the max QUAL, which could result\n in strange downstream confusion\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003c/ul\u003e",
