  "description": "\n\n \u003cp\u003e\n  This tool takes in two callsets (vcfs) and tabulates the number of sites which overlap and share alleles,\n  and for each sample, the genotype-by-genotype counts (e.g. the number of sites at which a sample was\n  called homozygous-reference in the EVAL callset, but homozygous-variant in the COMP callset). It outputs these\n  counts as well as convenient proportions (such as the proportion of het calls in the EVAL which were called REF in\n  the COMP) and metrics (such as NRD and NRS).\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003ch3\u003eInput\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n  Genotype concordance requires two callsets (as it does a comparison): an EVAL and a COMP callset, specified via\n  the -eval and -comp arguments. Typically, the EVAL callset is an experimental set you want to evaluate, while the\n  COMP callset is a previously existing set used as a standard for comparison (taken to represent \"truth\").\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n  (Optional) Jexl expressions for genotype-level filtering of EVAL or COMP genotypes, specified via the -gfe and\n  -cfe arguments, respectively.\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n  \u003ch3\u003eOutput\u003c/h3\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n  Genotype Concordance writes a GATK report to the specified file (via -o), consisting of multiple tables of counts\n  and proportions. These tables are constructed on a per-sample basis, and include counts of EVAL vs COMP genotype\n  states.\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003ch4\u003eTables\u003c/h4\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n  Headers for the (non-moltenized -- see below) GenotypeConcordance counts and proportions tables give the genotype of\n  the EVAL callset followed by the genotype of the COMP callset. For example the value corresponding to HOM_REF_HET\n  reflects variants called HOM_REF in the EVAL callset and HET in the COMP callset. Variants for which the alternate\n  alleles between the EVAL and COMP sample did not match are excluded from genotype comparisons and given in the\n  \"Mismatching_Alleles\" field.\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003e\n  It may be informative to reshape rows of the GenotypeConcordance counts and proportions tables into separate row-major tables\n  where the columns indicate the COMP genotype and the rows indicate the EVAL genotype for easy comparison between the\n  two callsets. This can be done with the gsa.reshape.concordance.table function in the gsalib R library.\n  In Excel this can be accomplished using the OFFSET function.\n  \u003c/p\u003e\n  \u003cul\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003e\u003ci\u003eGenotypeConcordance_CompProportions\u003c/i\u003e: Gives the proportion of variants in each category normalized to the total number of called genotypes in the COMP callset\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003e\u003ci\u003eGenotypeConcordance_Counts\u003c/i\u003e: Gives the counts for number of genotypes in each category\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003e\u003ci\u003eGenotypeConcordance_EvalProportions\u003c/i\u003e: Gives the proportion of genotypes in each category normalized to the total number of called genotypes in the EVAL callset\u003c/li\u003e\n      \u003cli\u003e\u003ci\u003eGenotypeConcordance_Summary\u003c/i\u003e: Summary statistics for the sum of all samples and each sample individually.
