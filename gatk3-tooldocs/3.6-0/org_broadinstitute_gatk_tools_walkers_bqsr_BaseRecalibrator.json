  "description": "\n\n \u003cp\u003e\n Variant calling algorithms rely heavily on the quality scores assigned to the individual base calls in each sequence\n read. These scores are per-base estimates of error emitted by the sequencing machines. Unfortunately the scores\n produced by the machines are subject to various sources of systematic technical error, leading to over- or\n under-estimated base quality scores in the data. Base quality score recalibration (BQSR) is a process in which we\n apply machine learning to model these errors empirically and adjust the quality scores accordingly. This allows us\n to get more accurate base qualities, which in turn improves the accuracy of our variant calls.\n\n The base recalibration process involves two key steps: first the program builds a model of covariation based on the\n data and a set of known variants (which you can bootstrap if there is none available for your organism), then it\n adjusts the base quality scores in the data based on the model.\n\n There is an optional but highly recommended step that involves building a second model and generating before/after\n plots to visualize the effects of the recalibration process. This is useful for quality control purposes.\n\n This tool performs the first step described above: it builds the model of covariation and produces the recalibration\n table. It operates only at sites that are not in dbSNP; we assume that all reference mismatches we see are therefore\n errors and indicative of poor base quality. This tool generates tables based on various user-specified covariates\n (such as read group, reported quality score, cycle, and context). Assuming we are working with a large amount of data,\n we can then calculate an empirical probability of error given the particular covariates seen at this site,\n where p(error) \u003d num mismatches / num observations.\n\n The output file is a table (of the several covariate values, number of observations, number of mismatches, empirical\n quality score).\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eInputs\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cp\u003e\n A BAM file containing data that needs to be recalibrated.\n \u003cp\u003e\n A database of known polymorphic sites to mask out.\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eOutput\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eA GATKReport file with many tables:\u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cul\u003e\n     \u003cli\u003eThe list of arguments\u003c/li\u003e\n     \u003cli\u003eThe quantized qualities table\u003c/li\u003e\n     \u003cli\u003eThe recalibration table by read group\u003c/li\u003e\n     \u003cli\u003eThe recalibration table by quality score\u003c/li\u003e\n     \u003cli\u003eThe recalibration table for all the optional covariates\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\n The GATKReport table format is intended to be easy to read by both humans and computer languages (especially R).\n Check out the documentation of the GATKReport (in the FAQs) to learn how to manipulate this table.\n \u003c/p\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eUsage example\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cpre\u003e\n java -jar GenomeAnalysisTK.jar \\\n   -T BaseRecalibrator \\\n   -R reference.fasta \\\n   -I my_reads.bam \\\n   -knownSites latest_dbsnp.vcf \\\n   -o recal_data.table\n \u003c/pre\u003e\n\n \u003ch3\u003eNotes\u003c/h3\u003e\n \u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThis *base* recalibration process should not be confused with *variant* recalibration, which is a s\n ophisticated filtering technique applied on the variant callset produced in a later step of the analysis workflow.\u003c/li\u003e\n \u003cli\u003eReadGroupCovariate and QualityScoreCovariate are required covariates and will be added regardless of whether\n or not they were specified.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e",
